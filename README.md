Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions
A workflow is a configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. You must create a YAML file to define your workflow configuration.

About YAML syntax for workflows
Workflow files use YAML syntax, and must have either a .yml or .yaml file extension. If you're new to YAML and want to learn more, see "Learn YAML in Y minutes."

You must store workflow files in the .github/workflows directory of your repository.

name
The name of the workflow. GitHub displays the names of your workflows under your repository's "Actions" tab. If you omit name, GitHub displays the workflow file path relative to the root of the repository.

run-name
The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow. GitHub displays the workflow run name in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab. If run-name is omitted or is only whitespace, then the run name is set to event-specific information for the workflow run. For example, for a workflow triggered by a push or pull_request event, it is set as the commit message or the title of the pull request.

This value can include expressions and can reference the github and inputs contexts.

Example of run-name
run-name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.deploy_target }} by @${{ github.actor }}
on
To automatically trigger a workflow, use on to define which events can cause the workflow to run. For a list of available events, see "Events that trigger workflows."

You can define single or multiple events that can trigger a workflow, or set a time schedule. You can also restrict the execution of a workflow to only occur for specific files, tags, or branch changes. These options are described in the following sections.

Using a single event
For example, a workflow with the following on value will run when a push is made to any branch in the workflow's repository:

on: push
Using multiple events
You can specify a single event or multiple events. For example, a workflow with the following on value will run when a push is made to any branch in the repository or when someone forks the repository:

on: [push, fork]
If you specify multiple events, only one of those events needs to occur to trigger your workflow. If multiple triggering events for your workflow occur at the same time, multiple workflow runs will be triggered.

Using activity types
Some events have activity types that give you more control over when your workflow should run. Use on.<event_name>.types to define the type of event activity that will trigger a workflow run.

For example, the issue_comment event has the created, edited, and deleted activity types. If your workflow triggers on the label event, it will run whenever a label is created, edited, or deleted. If you specify the created activity type for the label event, your workflow will run when a label is created but not when a label is edited or deleted.

on:
  label:
    types:
      - created
If you specify multiple activity types, only one of those event activity types needs to occur to trigger your workflow. If multiple triggering event activity types for your workflow occur at the same time, multiple workflow runs will be triggered. For example, the following workflow triggers when an issue is opened or labeled. If an issue with two labels is opened, three workflow runs will start: one for the issue opened event and two for the two issue labeled events.

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - opened
      - labeled
For more information about each event and their activity types, see "Events that trigger workflows."

Using filters
Some events have filters that give you more control over when your workflow should run.

For example, the push event has a branches filter that causes your workflow to run only when a push to a branch that matches the branches filter occurs, instead of when any push occurs.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/**'
Using activity types and filters with multiple events
If you specify activity types or filters for an event and your workflow triggers on multiple events, you must configure each event separately. You must append a colon (:) to all events, including events without configuration.

For example, a workflow with the following on value will run when:

A label is created
A push is made to the main branch in the repository
A push is made to a GitHub Pages-enabled branch
on:
  label:
    types:
      - created
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  page_build:
on.<event_name>.types
Use on.<event_name>.types to define the type of activity that will trigger a workflow run. Most GitHub events are triggered by more than one type of activity. For example, the label is triggered when a label is created, edited, or deleted. The types keyword enables you to narrow down activity that causes the workflow to run. When only one activity type triggers a webhook event, the types keyword is unnecessary.

You can use an array of event types. For more information about each event and their activity types, see "Events that trigger workflows."

on:
  label:
    types: [created, edited]
on.<pull_request|pull_request_target>.<branches|branches-ignore>
When using the pull_request and pull_request_target events, you can configure a workflow to run only for pull requests that target specific branches.

Use the branches filter when you want to include branch name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude branch names patterns. Use the branches-ignore filter when you only want to exclude branch name patterns. You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow.

If you define both branches/branches-ignore and paths/paths-ignore, the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

The branches and branches-ignore keywords accept glob patterns that use characters like *, **, +, ?, ! and others to match more than one branch name. If a name contains any of these characters and you want a literal match, you need to escape each of these special characters with \. For more information about glob patterns, see the "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Example: Including branches
The patterns defined in branches are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a pull_request event for a pull request targeting:

A branch named main (refs/heads/main)
A branch named mona/octocat (refs/heads/mona/octocat)
A branch whose name starts with releases/, like releases/10 (refs/heads/releases/10)
on:
  pull_request:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches:
      - main
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**'
If a workflow is skipped due to branch filtering, path filtering, or a commit message, then checks associated with that workflow will remain in a "Pending" state. A pull request that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from merging.

Example: Excluding branches
When a pattern matches the branches-ignore pattern, the workflow will not run. The patterns defined in branches-ignore are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a pull_request event unless the pull request is targeting:

A branch named mona/octocat (refs/heads/mona/octocat)
A branch whose name matches releases/**-alpha, like releases/beta/3-alpha (refs/heads/releases/beta/3-alpha)
on:
  pull_request:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches-ignore:
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**-alpha'
Example: Including and excluding branches
You cannot use branches and branches-ignore to filter the same event in a single workflow. If you want to both include and exclude branch patterns for a single event, use the branches filter along with the ! character to indicate which branches should be excluded.

If you define a branch with the ! character, you must also define at least one branch without the ! character. If you only want to exclude branches, use branches-ignore instead.

The order that you define patterns matters.

A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the Git ref.
A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the Git ref again.
The following workflow will run on pull_request events for pull requests that target releases/10 or releases/beta/mona, but not for pull requests that target releases/10-alpha or releases/beta/3-alpha because the negative pattern !releases/**-alpha follows the positive pattern.

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
      - '!releases/**-alpha'
on.push.<branches|tags|branches-ignore|tags-ignore>
When using the push event, you can configure a workflow to run on specific branches or tags.

Use the branches filter when you want to include branch name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude branch names patterns. Use the branches-ignore filter when you only want to exclude branch name patterns. You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow.

Use the tags filter when you want to include tag name patterns or when you want to both include and exclude tag names patterns. Use the tags-ignore filter when you only want to exclude tag name patterns. You cannot use both the tags and tags-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow.

If you define only tags/tags-ignore or only branches/branches-ignore, the workflow won't run for events affecting the undefined Git ref. If you define neither tags/tags-ignore or branches/branches-ignore, the workflow will run for events affecting either branches or tags. If you define both branches/branches-ignore and paths/paths-ignore, the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

The branches, branches-ignore, tags, and tags-ignore keywords accept glob patterns that use characters like *, **, +, ?, ! and others to match more than one branch or tag name. If a name contains any of these characters and you want a literal match, you need to escape each of these special characters with \. For more information about glob patterns, see the "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Example: Including branches and tags
The patterns defined in branches and tags are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a push event to:

A branch named main (refs/heads/main)
A branch named mona/octocat (refs/heads/mona/octocat)
A branch whose name starts with releases/, like releases/10 (refs/heads/releases/10)
A tag named v2 (refs/tags/v2)
A tag whose name starts with v1., like v1.9.1 (refs/tags/v1.9.1)
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches:    
      - main
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:        
      - v2
      - v1.*
Example: Excluding branches and tags
When a pattern matches the branches-ignore or tags-ignore pattern, the workflow will not run. The patterns defined in branches and tags are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, the following workflow would run whenever there is a push event, unless the push event is to:

A branch named mona/octocat (refs/heads/mona/octocat)
A branch whose name matches releases/**-alpha, like releases/beta/3-alpha (refs/heads/releases/beta/3-alpha)
A tag named v2 (refs/tags/v2)
A tag whose name starts with v1., like v1.9 (refs/tags/v1.9)
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/heads
    branches-ignore:    
      - 'mona/octocat'
      - 'releases/**-alpha'
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags-ignore:        
      - v2
      - v1.*
Example: Including and excluding branches and tags
You can't use branches and branches-ignore to filter the same event in a single workflow. Similarly, you can't use tags and tags-ignore to filter the same event in a single workflow. If you want to both include and exclude branch or tag patterns for a single event, use the branches or tags filter along with the ! character to indicate which branches or tags should be excluded.

If you define a branch with the ! character, you must also define at least one branch without the ! character. If you only want to exclude branches, use branches-ignore instead. Similarly, if you define a tag with the ! character, you must also define at least one tag without the ! character. If you only want to exclude tags, use tags-ignore instead.

The order that you define patterns matters.

A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the Git ref.
A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the Git ref again.
The following workflow will run on pushes to releases/10 or releases/beta/mona, but not on releases/10-alpha or releases/beta/3-alpha because the negative pattern !releases/**-alpha follows the positive pattern.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
      - '!releases/**-alpha'
on.<push|pull_request|pull_request_target>.<paths|paths-ignore>
When using the push and pull_request events, you can configure a workflow to run based on what file paths are changed. Path filters are not evaluated for pushes of tags.

Use the paths filter when you want to include file path patterns or when you want to both include and exclude file path patterns. Use the paths-ignore filter when you only want to exclude file path patterns. You cannot use both the paths and paths-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. If you want to both include and exclude path patterns for a single event, use the paths filter prefixed with the ! character to indicate which paths should be excluded.

Note: The order that you define paths patterns matters:

A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the path.
A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the path again.
If you define both branches/branches-ignore and paths/paths-ignore, the workflow will only run when both filters are satisfied.

The paths and paths-ignore keywords accept glob patterns that use the * and ** wildcard characters to match more than one path name. For more information, see the "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Example: Including paths
If at least one path matches a pattern in the paths filter, the workflow runs. For example, the following workflow would run anytime you push a JavaScript file (.js).

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.js'
If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering, branch filtering, or a commit message, then checks associated with that workflow will remain in a "Pending" state. A pull request that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from merging.

Example: Excluding paths
When all the path names match patterns in paths-ignore, the workflow will not run. If any path names do not match patterns in paths-ignore, even if some path names match the patterns, the workflow will run.

A workflow with the following path filter will only run on push events that include at least one file outside the docs directory at the root of the repository.

on:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'
Example: Including and excluding paths
You cannot use paths and paths-ignore to filter the same event in a single workflow. If you want to both include and exclude path patterns for a single event, use the paths filter prefixed with the ! character to indicate which paths should be excluded.

If you define a path with the ! character, you must also define at least one path without the ! character. If you only want to exclude paths, use paths-ignore instead.

The order that you define paths patterns matters:

A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the path.
A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the path again.
This example runs anytime the push event includes a file in the sub-project directory or its subdirectories, unless the file is in the sub-project/docs directory. For example, a push that changed sub-project/index.js or sub-project/src/index.js will trigger a workflow run, but a push changing only sub-project/docs/readme.md will not.

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'sub-project/**'
      - '!sub-project/docs/**'
Git diff comparisons
Note: If you push more than 1,000 commits, or if GitHub does not generate the diff due to a timeout, the workflow will always run.

The filter determines if a workflow should run by evaluating the changed files and running them against the paths-ignore or paths list. If there are no files changed, the workflow will not run.

GitHub generates the list of changed files using two-dot diffs for pushes and three-dot diffs for pull requests:

Pull requests: Three-dot diffs are a comparison between the most recent version of the topic branch and the commit where the topic branch was last synced with the base branch.
Pushes to existing branches: A two-dot diff compares the head and base SHAs directly with each other.
Pushes to new branches: A two-dot diff against the parent of the ancestor of the deepest commit pushed.
Diffs are limited to 300 files. If there are files changed that aren't matched in the first 300 files returned by the filter, the workflow will not run. You may need to create more specific filters so that the workflow will run automatically.

For more information, see "About comparing branches in pull requests."

on.schedule
You can use on.schedule to define a time schedule for your workflows. You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using POSIX cron syntax. Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.

This example triggers the workflow every day at 5:30 and 17:30 UTC:

on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '30 5,17 * * *'
A single workflow can be triggered by multiple schedule events. You can access the schedule event that triggered the workflow through the github.event.schedule context. This example triggers the workflow to run at 5:30 UTC every Monday-Thursday, but skips the Not on Monday or Wednesday step on Monday and Wednesday.

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 5 * * 1,3'
    - cron: '30 5 * * 2,4'

jobs:
  test_schedule:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Not on Monday or Wednesday
        if: github.event.schedule != '30 5 * * 1,3'
        run: echo "This step will be skipped on Monday and Wednesday"
      - name: Every time
        run: echo "This step will always run"
For more information about cron syntax, see "Events that trigger workflows."

on.workflow_call
Use on.workflow_call to define the inputs and outputs for a reusable workflow. You can also map the secrets that are available to the called workflow. For more information on reusable workflows, see "Reusing workflows."

on.workflow_call.inputs
When using the workflow_call keyword, you can optionally specify inputs that are passed to the called workflow from the caller workflow. For more information about the workflow_call keyword, see "Events that trigger workflows."

In addition to the standard input parameters that are available, on.workflow_call.inputs requires a type parameter. For more information, see on.workflow_call.inputs.<input_id>.type.

If a default parameter is not set, the default value of the input is false for a boolean, 0 for a number, and "" for a string.

Within the called workflow, you can use the inputs context to refer to an input. For more information, see "Contexts."

If a caller workflow passes an input that is not specified in the called workflow, this results in an error.

Example of on.workflow_call.inputs
on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      username:
        description: 'A username passed from the caller workflow'
        default: 'john-doe'
        required: false
        type: string

jobs:
  print-username:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Print the input name to STDOUT
        run: echo The username is ${{ inputs.username }}
For more information, see "Reusing workflows."

on.workflow_call.inputs.<input_id>.type
Required if input is defined for the on.workflow_call keyword. The value of this parameter is a string specifying the data type of the input. This must be one of: boolean, number, or string.

on.workflow_call.outputs
A map of outputs for a called workflow. Called workflow outputs are available to all downstream jobs in the caller workflow. Each output has an identifier, an optional description, and a value. The value must be set to the value of an output from a job within the called workflow.

In the example below, two outputs are defined for this reusable workflow: workflow_output1 and workflow_output2. These are mapped to outputs called job_output1 and job_output2, both from a job called my_job.

Example of on.workflow_call.outputs
on:
  workflow_call:
    # Map the workflow outputs to job outputs
    outputs:
      workflow_output1:
        description: "The first job output"
        value: ${{ jobs.my_job.outputs.job_output1 }}
      workflow_output2:
        description: "The second job output"
        value: ${{ jobs.my_job.outputs.job_output2 }}
For information on how to reference a job output, see jobs.<job_id>.outputs. For more information, see "Reusing workflows."

on.workflow_call.secrets
A map of the secrets that can be used in the called workflow.

Within the called workflow, you can use the secrets context to refer to a secret.

Note: If you are passing the secret to a nested reusable workflow, then you must use jobs.<job_id>.secrets again to pass the secret. For more information, see "Reusing workflows."

If a caller workflow passes a secret that is not specified in the called workflow, this results in an error.

Example of on.workflow_call.secrets
on:
  workflow_call:
    secrets:
      access-token:
        description: 'A token passed from the caller workflow'
        required: false

jobs:

  pass-secret-to-action:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # passing the secret to an action
      - name: Pass the received secret to an action
        uses: ./.github/actions/my-action
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.access-token }}

  # passing the secret to a nested reusable workflow
  pass-secret-to-workflow:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/my-workflow
    secrets:
       token: ${{ secrets.access-token }}
on.workflow_call.secrets.<secret_id>
A string identifier to associate with the secret.

on.workflow_call.secrets.<secret_id>.required
A boolean specifying whether the secret must be supplied.

on.workflow_run.<branches|branches-ignore>
When using the workflow_run event, you can specify what branches the triggering workflow must run on in order to trigger your workflow.

The branches and branches-ignore filters accept glob patterns that use characters like *, **, +, ?, ! and others to match more than one branch name. If a name contains any of these characters and you want a literal match, you need to escape each of these special characters with \. For more information about glob patterns, see the "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

For example, a workflow with the following trigger will only run when the workflow named Build runs on a branch whose name starts with releases/:

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
A workflow with the following trigger will only run when the workflow named Build runs on a branch that is not named canary:

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches-ignore:
      - "canary"
You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. If you want to both include and exclude branch patterns for a single event, use the branches filter along with the ! character to indicate which branches should be excluded.

The order that you define patterns matters.

A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the branch.
A matching positive pattern after a negative match will include the branch again.
For example, a workflow with the following trigger will run when the workflow named Build runs on a branch that is named releases/10 or releases/beta/mona but will not releases/10-alpha, releases/beta/3-alpha, or main.

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build"]
    types: [requested]
    branches:
      - 'releases/**'
      - '!releases/**-alpha'
on.workflow_dispatch
When using the workflow_dispatch event, you can optionally specify inputs that are passed to the workflow.

This trigger only receives events when the workflow file is on the default branch.

on.workflow_dispatch.inputs
The triggered workflow receives the inputs in the inputs context. For more information, see "Contexts."

Notes:

The workflow will also receive the inputs in the github.event.inputs context. The information in the inputs context and github.event.inputs context is identical except that the inputs context preserves Boolean values as Booleans instead of converting them to strings. The choice type resolves to a string and is a single selectable option.
The maximum number of top-level properties for inputs is 10.
The maximum payload for inputs is 65,535 characters.
Example of on.workflow_dispatch.inputs
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      logLevel:
        description: 'Log level'
        required: true
        default: 'warning'
        type: choice

A boolean specifying whether the input must be supplied.

on.workflow_dispatch.inputs.<input_id>.type
The value of this parameter is a string specifying the data type of the input. This must be one of: boolean, choice, number, environment or string.

permissions
You can use permissions to modify the default permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. For more information, see "Automatic token authentication."

You can use permissions either as a top-level key, to apply to all jobs in the workflow, or within specific jobs. When you add the permissions key within a specific job, all actions and run commands within that job that use the GITHUB_TOKEN gain the access rights you specify. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.permissions.

For each of the available scopes, shown in the table below, you can assign one of the permissions: read, write, or none. If you specify the access for any of these scopes, all of those that are not specified are set to none.

Available scopes and details of what each allows an action to do:

Scope	Allows an action using GITHUB_TOKEN to
actions	Work with GitHub Actions. For example, actions: write permits an action to cancel a workflow run. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
attestations	Work with artifact attestations. For example, attestations: write permits an action to generate an artifact attestation for a build. For more information, see "Using artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds"
checks	Work with check runs and check suites. For example, checks: write permits an action to create a check run. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
contents	Work with the contents of the repository. For example, contents: read permits an action to list the commits, and contents: write allows the action to create a release. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
deployments	Work with deployments. For example, deployments: write permits an action to create a new deployment. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
discussions	Work with GitHub Discussions. For example, discussions: write permits an action to close or delete a discussion. For more information, see "Using the GraphQL API for Discussions."
id-token	Fetch an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token. This requires id-token: write. For more information, see "About security hardening with OpenID Connect"
issues	Work with issues. For example, issues: write permits an action to add a comment to an issue. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
packages	Work with GitHub Packages. For example, packages: write permits an action to upload and publish packages on GitHub Packages. For more information, see "About permissions for GitHub Packages."
pages	Work with GitHub Pages. For example, pages: write permits an action to request a GitHub Pages build. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
pull-requests	Work with pull requests. For example, pull-requests: write permits an action to add a label to a pull request. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
repository-projects	Work with GitHub projects (classic). For example, repository-projects: write permits an action to add a column to a project (classic). For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
security-events	Work with GitHub code scanning and Dependabot alerts. For example, security-events: read permits an action to list the Dependabot alerts for the repository, and security-events: write allows an action to update the status of a code scanning alert. For more information, see "Repository permissions for 'Code scanning alerts'" and "Repository permissions for 'Dependabot alerts'" in "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
statuses	Work with commit statuses. For example, statuses:read permits an action to list the commit statuses for a given reference. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
Defining access for the GITHUB_TOKEN scopes
You can define the access that the GITHUB_TOKEN will permit by specifying read, write, or none as the value of the available scopes within the permissions key.

permissions:
  actions: read|write|none
  checks: read|write|none
  contents: read|write|none
  deployments: read|write|none
  id-token: read|write|none
  issues: read|write|none
  discussions: read|write|none
  packages: read|write|none
  pages: read|write|none
  pull-requests: read|write|none
  repository-projects: read|write|none
  security-events: read|write|none
  statuses: read|write|none
If you specify the access for any of these scopes, all of those that are not specified are set to none.

You can use the following syntax to define one of read-all or write-all access for all of the available scopes:

permissions: read-all
permissions: write-all
You can use the following syntax to disable permissions for all of the available scopes:

permissions: {}
Changing the permissions in a forked repository
You can use the permissions key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests option in the GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see "Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository."

Setting the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions for all jobs in a workflow
You can specify permissions at the top level of a workflow, so that the setting applies to all jobs in the workflow.

Example: Setting the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions for an entire workflow
This example shows permissions being set for the GITHUB_TOKEN that will apply to all jobs in the workflow. All permissions are granted read access.

name: "My workflow"

on: [ push ]

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  ...
env
A map of variables that are available to the steps of all jobs in the workflow. You can also set variables that are only available to the steps of a single job or to a single step. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.env and jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env.

Variables in the env map cannot be defined in terms of other variables in the map.

When more than one environment variable is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific variable. For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow environment variables with the same name, while the step executes. An environment variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name, while the job executes.

Example of env
env:
  SERVER: production
defaults
Use defaults to create a map of default settings that will apply to all jobs in the workflow. You can also set default settings that are only available to a job. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.defaults.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

defaults.run
You can use defaults.run to provide default shell and working-directory options for all run steps in a workflow. You can also set default settings for run that are only available to a job. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run. You cannot use contexts or expressions in this keyword.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

Example: Set the default shell and working directory
defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash
    working-directory: ./scripts
defaults.run.shell
Use shell to define the shell for a step. This keyword can reference several contexts. For more information, see "Contexts."

Supported platform	shell parameter	Description	Command run internally
Linux / macOS	unspecified	The default shell on non-Windows platforms. Note that this runs a different command to when bash is specified explicitly. If bash is not found in the path, this is treated as sh.	bash -e {0}
All	bash	The default shell on non-Windows platforms with a fallback to sh. When specifying a bash shell on Windows, the bash shell included with Git for Windows is used.	bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}
All	pwsh	The PowerShell Core. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name.	pwsh -command ". '{0}'"
All	python	Executes the python command.	python {0}
Linux / macOS	sh	The fallback behavior for non-Windows platforms if no shell is provided and bash is not found in the path.	sh -e {0}
Windows	cmd	GitHub appends the extension .cmd to your script name and substitutes for {0}.	%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C "CALL "{0}"".
Windows	pwsh	This is the default shell used on Windows. The PowerShell Core. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name. If your self-hosted Windows runner does not have PowerShell Core installed, then PowerShell Desktop is used instead.	pwsh -command ". '{0}'".
Windows	powershell	The PowerShell Desktop. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name.	powershell -command ". '{0}'".
When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.			
defaults.run.working-directory
Use working-directory to define the working directory for the shell for a step. This keyword can reference several contexts. For more information, see "Contexts."

Tip: Ensure the working-directory you assign exists on the runner before you run your shell in it.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.
concurrency
Use concurrency to ensure that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. The expression can only use github, inputs and vars contexts. For more information about expressions, see "Expressions."

You can also specify concurrency at the job level. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.concurrency.

When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be pending. Any pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled. This means that there can be at most one running and one pending job in a concurrency group at any time.

To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify cancel-in-progress: true. To conditionally cancel currently running jobs or workflows in the same concurrency group, you can specify cancel-in-progress as an expression with any of the allowed expression contexts.

Notes:

The concurrency group name is case insensitive. For example, prod and Prod will be treated as the same concurrency group.
Ordering is not guaranteed for jobs or workflow runs using concurrency groups. Jobs or workflow runs in the same concurrency group are handled in an arbitrary order.
Example: Using concurrency and the default behavior
The default behavior of GitHub Actions is to allow multiple jobs or workflow runs to run concurrently. The concurrency keyword allows you to control the concurrency of workflow runs.

For example, you can use the concurrency keyword immediately after where trigger conditions are defined to limit the concurrency of entire workflow runs for a specific branch:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
You can also limit the concurrency of jobs within a workflow by using the concurrency keyword at the job level:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: example-group
      cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Concurrency groups
Concurrency groups provide a way to manage and limit the execution of workflow runs or jobs that share the same concurrency key.

The concurrency key is used to group workflows or jobs together into a concurrency group. When you define a concurrency key, GitHub Actions ensures that only one workflow or job with that key runs at any given time. If a new workflow run or job starts with the same concurrency key, GitHub Actions will cancel any workflow or job already running with that key. The concurrency key can be a hard-coded string, or it can be a dynamic expression that includes context variables.

It is possible to define concurrency conditions in your workflow so that the workflow or job is part of a concurrency group.

This means that when a workflow run or job starts, GitHub will cancel any workflow runs or jobs that are already in progress in the same concurrency group. This is useful in scenarios where you want to prevent parallel runs for a certain set of a workflows or jobs, such as the ones used for deployments to a staging environment, in order to prevent actions that could cause conflicts or consume more resources than necessary.

In this example, job-1 is part of a concurrency group named staging_environment. This means that if a new run of job-1 is triggered, any runs of the same job in the staging_environment concurrency group that are already in progress will be cancelled.

jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: staging_environment
      cancel-in-progress: true
Alternatively, using a dynamic expression such as concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }} in your workflow means that the workflow or job would be part of a concurrency group named ci- followed by the reference of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. In this example, if a new commit is pushed to the main branch while a previous run is still in progress, the previous run will be cancelled and the new one will start:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Using concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run
To use concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run in GitHub Actions, you can use the concurrency key with the cancel-in-progress option set to true:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Note that in this example, without defining a particular concurrency group, GitHub Actions will cancel any in-progress run of the job or workflow.

Example: Using a fallback value
If you build the group name with a property that is only defined for specific events, you can use a fallback value. For example, github.head_ref is only defined on pull_request events. If your workflow responds to other events in addition to pull_request events, you will need to provide a fallback to avoid a syntax error. The following concurrency group cancels in-progress jobs or runs on pull_request events only; if github.head_ref is undefined, the concurrency group will fallback to the run ID, which is guaranteed to be both unique and defined for the run.

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs or runs for the current workflow
If you have multiple workflows in the same repository, concurrency group names must be unique across workflows to avoid canceling in-progress jobs or runs from other workflows. Otherwise, any previously in-progress or pending job will be canceled, regardless of the workflow.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow, you can use the github.workflow property to build the concurrency group:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs on specific branches
If you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on certain branches but not on others, you can use conditional expressions with cancel-in-progress. For example, you can do this if you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on development branches but not on release branches.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow when not running on a release branch, you can set cancel-in-progress to an expression similar to the following:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ !contains(github.ref, 'release/')}}
In this example, multiple pushes to a release/1.2.3 branch would not cancel in-progress runs. Pushes to another branch, such as main, would cancel in-progress runs.

jobs
A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs, which run in parallel by default. To run jobs sequentially, you can define dependencies on other jobs using the jobs.<job_id>.needs keyword.

Each job runs in a runner environment specified by runs-on.

You can run an unlimited number of jobs as long as you are within the workflow usage limits. For more information, see "Usage limits, billing, and administration" for GitHub-hosted runners and "About self-hosted runners" for self-hosted runner usage limits.

If you need to find the unique identifier of a job running in a workflow run, you can use the GitHub API. For more information, see "REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions."

jobs.<job_id>
Use jobs.<job_id> to give your job a unique identifier. The key job_id is a string and its value is a map of the job's configuration data. You must replace <job_id> with a string that is unique to the jobs object. The <job_id> must start with a letter or _ and contain only alphanumeric characters, -, or _.

Example: Creating jobs
In this example, two jobs have been created, and their job_id values are my_first_job and my_second_job.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
jobs.<job_id>.name
Use jobs.<job_id>.name to set a name for the job, which is displayed in the GitHub UI.

jobs.<job_id>.permissions
For a specific job, you can use jobs.<job_id>.permissions to modify the default permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. For more information, see "Automatic token authentication."

By specifying the permission within a job definition, you can configure a different set of permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN for each job, if required. Alternatively, you can specify the permissions for all jobs in the workflow. For information on defining permissions at the workflow level, see permissions.

For each of the available scopes, shown in the table below, you can assign one of the permissions: read, write, or none. If you specify the access for any of these scopes, all of those that are not specified are set to none.

Available scopes and details of what each allows an action to do:

Scope	Allows an action using GITHUB_TOKEN to
actions	Work with GitHub Actions. For example, actions: write permits an action to cancel a workflow run. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
attestations	Work with artifact attestations. For example, attestations: write permits an action to generate an artifact attestation for a build. For more information, see "Using artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds"
checks	Work with check runs and check suites. For example, checks: write permits an action to create a check run. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
contents	Work with the contents of the repository. For example, contents: read permits an action to list the commits, and contents: write allows the action to create a release. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
deployments	Work with deployments. For example, deployments: write permits an action to create a new deployment. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
discussions	Work with GitHub Discussions. For example, discussions: write permits an action to close or delete a discussion. For more information, see "Using the GraphQL API for Discussions."
id-token	Fetch an OpenID Connect (OIDC) token. This requires id-token: write. For more information, see "About security hardening with OpenID Connect"
issues	Work with issues. For example, issues: write permits an action to add a comment to an issue. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
packages	Work with GitHub Packages. For example, packages: write permits an action to upload and publish packages on GitHub Packages. For more information, see "About permissions for GitHub Packages."
pages	Work with GitHub Pages. For example, pages: write permits an action to request a GitHub Pages build. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
pull-requests	Work with pull requests. For example, pull-requests: write permits an action to add a label to a pull request. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
repository-projects	Work with GitHub projects (classic). For example, repository-projects: write permits an action to add a column to a project (classic). For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
security-events	Work with GitHub code scanning and Dependabot alerts. For example, security-events: read permits an action to list the Dependabot alerts for the repository, and security-events: write allows an action to update the status of a code scanning alert. For more information, see "Repository permissions for 'Code scanning alerts'" and "Repository permissions for 'Dependabot alerts'" in "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
statuses	Work with commit statuses. For example, statuses:read permits an action to list the commit statuses for a given reference. For more information, see "Permissions required for GitHub Apps."
Defining access for the GITHUB_TOKEN scopes
You can define the access that the GITHUB_TOKEN will permit by specifying read, write, or none as the value of the available scopes within the permissions key.

permissions:
  actions: read|write|none
  checks: read|write|none
  contents: read|write|none
  deployments: read|write|none
  id-token: read|write|none
  issues: read|write|none
  discussions: read|write|none
  packages: read|write|none
  pages: read|write|none
  pull-requests: read|write|none
  repository-projects: read|write|none
  security-events: read|write|none
  statuses: read|write|none
If you specify the access for any of these scopes, all of those that are not specified are set to none.

You can use the following syntax to define one of read-all or write-all access for all of the available scopes:

permissions: read-all
permissions: write-all
You can use the following syntax to disable permissions for all of the available scopes:

permissions: {}
Changing the permissions in a forked repository
You can use the permissions key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests option in the GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see "Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository."

Example: Setting the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions for one job in a workflow
This example shows permissions being set for the GITHUB_TOKEN that will only apply to the job named stale. Write access is granted for the issues and pull-requests scopes. All other scopes will have no access.

jobs:
  stale:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/stale@v5
jobs.<job_id>.needs
Use jobs.<job_id>.needs to identify any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. It can be a string or array of strings. If a job fails or is skipped, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional expression that causes the job to continue. If a run contains a series of jobs that need each other, a failure or skip applies to all jobs in the dependency chain from the point of failure or skip onwards. If you would like a job to run even if a job it is dependent on did not succeed, use the always() conditional expression in jobs.<job_id>.if.

Example: Requiring successful dependent jobs
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
In this example, job1 must complete successfully before job2 begins, and job3 waits for both job1 and job2 to complete.

The jobs in this example run sequentially:

job1
job2
job3
Example: Not requiring successful dependent jobs
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    if: ${{ always() }}
    needs: [job1, job2]
In this example, job3 uses the always() conditional expression so that it always runs after job1 and job2 have completed, regardless of whether they were successful. For more information, see "Expressions."

jobs.<job_id>.if
You can use the jobs.<job_id>.if conditional to prevent a job from running unless a condition is met. You can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional. For more information on which contexts are supported in this key, see "Contexts."

Note: The jobs.<job_id>.if condition is evaluated before jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix is applied.

When you use expressions in an if conditional, you can, optionally, omit the ${{ }} expression syntax because GitHub Actions automatically evaluates the if conditional as an expression. However, this exception does not apply everywhere.

You must always use the ${{ }} expression syntax or escape with '', "", or () when the expression starts with !, since ! is reserved notation in YAML format. For example:

if: ${{ ! startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') }}
For more information, see "Expressions."

Example: Only run job for specific repository
This example uses if to control when the production-deploy job can run. It will only run if the repository is named octo-repo-prod and is within the octo-org organization. Otherwise, the job will be marked as skipped.

YAML
name: example-workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  production-deploy:
    if: github.repository == 'octo-org/octo-repo-prod'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
jobs.<job_id>.runs-on
Use jobs.<job_id>.runs-on to define the type of machine to run the job on.

The destination machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner, larger runner, or a self-hosted runner.
You can target runners based on the labels assigned to them, or their group membership, or a combination of these.
You can provide runs-on as:

A single string
A single variable containing a string
An array of strings, variables containing strings, or a combination of both
A key: value pair using the group or labels keys
If you specify an array of strings or variables, your workflow will execute on any runner that matches all of the specified runs-on values. For example, here the job will only run on a self-hosted runner that has the labels linux, x64, and gpu:

runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
For more information, see "Choosing self-hosted runners."

You can mix strings and variables in an array. For example:

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      chosen-os:
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
        - Ubuntu
        - macOS

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, "${{ inputs.chosen-os }}"]
    steps:
    - run: echo Hello world!
If you would like to run your workflow on multiple machines, use jobs.<job_id>.strategy.

Note: Quotation marks are not required around simple strings like self-hosted, but they are required for expressions like "${{ inputs.chosen-os }}".

Choosing GitHub-hosted runners
If you use a GitHub-hosted runner, each job runs in a fresh instance of a runner image specified by runs-on.

The value for runs-on, when you are using a GitHub-hosted runner, is a runner label or the name of a runner group. The labels for the standard GitHub-hosted runners are shown in the following tables.

For more information, see "About GitHub-hosted runners."

Standard GitHub-hosted runners for Public repositories
For public repositories, jobs using the workflow labels shown in the table below will run on virtual machines with the associated specifications. The use of these runners on public repositories is free and unlimited.

Virtual Machine	Processor (CPU)	Memory (RAM)	Storage (SSD)	Workflow label	Notes
Linux	4	16 GB	14 GB	ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04 [Beta], ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-20.04	The ubuntu-latest label currently uses the Ubuntu 22.04 runner image.
Windows	4	16 GB	14 GB	windows-latest, windows-2022, windows-2019	The windows-latest label currently uses the Windows 2022 runner image.
macOS	3	14 GB	14 GB	macos-12 or macos-11	The macos-11 label has been deprecated and will no longer be available after 28 June 2024.
macOS	4	14 GB	14 GB	macos-13	N/A
macOS	3 (M1)	7 GB	14 GB	macos-latest or macos-14	The macos-latest label currently uses the macOS 14 runner image.
Standard GitHub-hosted runners for Private repositories
For private repositories, jobs using the workflow labels shown in the table below will run on virtual machines with the associated specifications. These runners use your GitHub account's allotment of free minutes, and are then charged at the per minute rates. For more information, see "About billing for GitHub Actions."

Virtual Machine	Processor (CPU)	Memory (RAM)	Storage (SSD)	Workflow label	Notes
Linux	2	7 GB	14 GB	ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04 [Beta], ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-20.04	The ubuntu-latest label currently uses the Ubuntu 22.04 runner image.
Windows	2	7 GB	14 GB	windows-latest, windows-2022, windows-2019	The windows-latest label currently uses the Windows 2022 runner image.
macOS	3	14 GB	14 GB	macos-12 or macos-11	The macos-11 label has been deprecated and will no longer be available after 28 June 2024.
macOS	4	14 GB	14 GB	macos-13	N/A
macOS	3 (M1)	7 GB	14 GB	macos-latest or macos-14	The macos-latestlabel currently uses the macOS 14 runner image.
In addition to the standard GitHub-hosted runners, GitHub offers customers on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud plans a range of managed virtual machines with advanced features - for example, more cores and disk space, GPU-powered machines, and ARM-powered machines. For more information, see "About larger runners."

Note: The -latest runner images are the latest stable images that GitHub provides, and might not be the most recent version of the operating system available from the operating system vendor.

Warning: Beta and Deprecated Images are provided "as-is", "with all faults" and "as available" and are excluded from the service level agreement and warranty. Beta Images may not be covered by customer support.

Example: Specifying an operating system
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
For more information, see "Using GitHub-hosted runners."

Choosing self-hosted runners
To specify a self-hosted runner for your job, configure runs-on in your workflow file with self-hosted runner labels.

Self-hosted runners may have the self-hosted label. When setting up a self-hosted runner, by default we will include the label self-hosted. You may pass in the --no-default-labels flag to prevent the self-hosted label from being applied. Labels can be used to create targeting options for runners, such as operating system or architecture, we recommend providing an array of labels that begins with self-hosted (this must be listed first) and then includes additional labels as needed. When you specify an array of labels, jobs will be queued on runners that have all the labels that you specify.

Note that Action-runner-controller does not support multiple labels and does not support the self-hosted label.

Example: Using labels for runner selection
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
For more information, see "About self-hosted runners" and "Using self-hosted runners in a workflow."

Choosing runners in a group
You can use runs-on to target runner groups, so that the job will execute on any runner that is a member of that group. For more granular control, you can also combine runner groups with labels.

Runner groups can only have larger runners or self-hosted runners as members.

Example: Using groups to control where jobs are run
In this example, Ubuntu runners have been added to a group called ubuntu-runners. The runs-on key sends the job to any available runner in the ubuntu-runners group:

name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on: 
      group: ubuntu-runners
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
Example: Combining groups and labels
When you combine groups and labels, the runner must meet both requirements to be eligible to run the job.

In this example, a runner group called ubuntu-runners is populated with Ubuntu runners, which have also been assigned the label ubuntu-20.04-16core. The runs-on key combines group and labels so that the job is routed to any available runner within the group that also has a matching label:

name: learn-github-actions
on: [push]
jobs:
  check-bats-version:
    runs-on:
      group: ubuntu-runners
      labels: ubuntu-20.04-16core
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install -g bats
      - run: bats -v
jobs.<job_id>.environment
Use jobs.<job_id>.environment to define the environment that the job references. All deployment protection rules must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner. For more information, see "Using environments for deployment."

You can provide the environment as only the environment name, or as an environment object with the name and url. The URL maps to environment_url in the deployments API. For more information about the deployments API, see "REST API endpoints for repositories."

Example: Using a single environment name
environment: staging_environment
Example: Using environment name and URL
environment:
  name: production_environment
  url: https://github.com
The value of url can be an expression. Allowed expression contexts: github, inputs, vars, needs, strategy, matrix, job, runner, and env. For more information about expressions, see "Expressions."

Example: Using output as URL
environment:
  name: production_environment
  url: ${{ steps.step_id.outputs.url_output }}
The value of name can be an expression. Allowed expression contexts: github, inputs, vars, needs, strategy, and matrix. For more information about expressions, see "Expressions."

Example: Using an expression as environment name
environment:
  name: ${{ github.ref_name }}
jobs.<job_id>.concurrency
You can use jobs.<job_id>.concurrency to ensure that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. Allowed expression contexts: github, inputs, vars, needs, strategy, and matrix. For more information about expressions, see "Expressions."

You can also specify concurrency at the workflow level. For more information, see concurrency.

When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be pending. Any pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled. This means that there can be at most one running and one pending job in a concurrency group at any time.

To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify cancel-in-progress: true. To conditionally cancel currently running jobs or workflows in the same concurrency group, you can specify cancel-in-progress as an expression with any of the allowed expression contexts.

Notes:

The concurrency group name is case insensitive. For example, prod and Prod will be treated as the same concurrency group.
Ordering is not guaranteed for jobs or workflow runs using concurrency groups. Jobs or workflow runs in the same concurrency group are handled in an arbitrary order.
Example: Using concurrency and the default behavior
The default behavior of GitHub Actions is to allow multiple jobs or workflow runs to run concurrently. The concurrency keyword allows you to control the concurrency of workflow runs.

For example, you can use the concurrency keyword immediately after where trigger conditions are defined to limit the concurrency of entire workflow runs for a specific branch:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
You can also limit the concurrency of jobs within a workflow by using the concurrency keyword at the job level:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: example-group
      cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Concurrency groups
Concurrency groups provide a way to manage and limit the execution of workflow runs or jobs that share the same concurrency key.

The concurrency key is used to group workflows or jobs together into a concurrency group. When you define a concurrency key, GitHub Actions ensures that only one workflow or job with that key runs at any given time. If a new workflow run or job starts with the same concurrency key, GitHub Actions will cancel any workflow or job already running with that key. The concurrency key can be a hard-coded string, or it can be a dynamic expression that includes context variables.

It is possible to define concurrency conditions in your workflow so that the workflow or job is part of a concurrency group.

This means that when a workflow run or job starts, GitHub will cancel any workflow runs or jobs that are already in progress in the same concurrency group. This is useful in scenarios where you want to prevent parallel runs for a certain set of a workflows or jobs, such as the ones used for deployments to a staging environment, in order to prevent actions that could cause conflicts or consume more resources than necessary.

In this example, job-1 is part of a concurrency group named staging_environment. This means that if a new run of job-1 is triggered, any runs of the same job in the staging_environment concurrency group that are already in progress will be cancelled.

jobs:
  job-1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: staging_environment
      cancel-in-progress: true
Alternatively, using a dynamic expression such as concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }} in your workflow means that the workflow or job would be part of a concurrency group named ci- followed by the reference of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. In this example, if a new commit is pushed to the main branch while a previous run is still in progress, the previous run will be cancelled and the new one will start:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Using concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run
To use concurrency to cancel any in-progress job or run in GitHub Actions, you can use the concurrency key with the cancel-in-progress option set to true:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Note that in this example, without defining a particular concurrency group, GitHub Actions will cancel any in-progress run of the job or workflow.

Example: Using a fallback value
If you build the group name with a property that is only defined for specific events, you can use a fallback value. For example, github.head_ref is only defined on pull_request events. If your workflow responds to other events in addition to pull_request events, you will need to provide a fallback to avoid a syntax error. The following concurrency group cancels in-progress jobs or runs on pull_request events only; if github.head_ref is undefined, the concurrency group will fallback to the run ID, which is guaranteed to be both unique and defined for the run.

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs or runs for the current workflow
If you have multiple workflows in the same repository, concurrency group names must be unique across workflows to avoid canceling in-progress jobs or runs from other workflows. Otherwise, any previously in-progress or pending job will be canceled, regardless of the workflow.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow, you can use the github.workflow property to build the concurrency group:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
Example: Only cancel in-progress jobs on specific branches
If you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on certain branches but not on others, you can use conditional expressions with cancel-in-progress. For example, you can do this if you would like to cancel in-progress jobs on development branches but not on release branches.

To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow when not running on a release branch, you can set cancel-in-progress to an expression similar to the following:

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ !contains(github.ref, 'release/')}}
In this example, multiple pushes to a release/1.2.3 branch would not cancel in-progress runs. Pushes to another branch, such as main, would cancel in-progress runs.

jobs.<job_id>.outputs
You can use jobs.<job_id>.outputs to create a map of outputs for a job. Job outputs are available to all downstream jobs that depend on this job. For more information on defining job dependencies, see jobs.<job_id>.needs.

Outputs are Unicode strings, and can be a maximum of 1 MB. The total of all outputs in a workflow run can be a maximum of 50 MB.

Job outputs containing expressions are evaluated on the runner at the end of each job. Outputs containing secrets are redacted on the runner and not sent to GitHub Actions.

To use job outputs in a dependent job, you can use the needs context. For more information, see "Contexts."

Note: $GITHUB_OUTPUT is shared between all steps in a job. If you use the same output name in multiple steps, the last step to write to the output will override the value. If your job uses a matrix and writes to $GITHUB_OUTPUT, the content will be overwritten for each matrix combination. You can use the matrix context to create unique output names for each job configuration. For more information, see "Contexts."

Example: Defining outputs for a job
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Map a step output to a job output
    outputs:
      output1: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.test }}
      output2: ${{ steps.step2.outputs.test }}
    steps:
      - id: step1
        run: echo "test=hello" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      - id: step2
        run: echo "test=world" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1
    steps:
      - env:
          OUTPUT1: ${{needs.job1.outputs.output1}}
          OUTPUT2: ${{needs.job1.outputs.output2}}
        run: echo "$OUTPUT1 $OUTPUT2"
jobs.<job_id>.env
A map of variables that are available to all steps in the job. You can set variables for the entire workflow or an individual step. For more information, see env and jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env.

When more than one environment variable is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific variable. For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow environment variables with the same name, while the step executes. An environment variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name, while the job executes.

Example of jobs.<job_id>.env
jobs:
  job1:
    env:
      FIRST_NAME: Mona
jobs.<job_id>.defaults
Use jobs.<job_id>.defaults to create a map of default settings that will apply to all steps in the job. You can also set default settings for the entire workflow. For more information, see defaults.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run
Use jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run to provide default shell and working-directory to all run steps in the job.

You can provide default shell and working-directory options for all run steps in a job. You can also set default settings for run for the entire workflow. For more information, see defaults.run.

These can be overriden at the jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run and jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].run levels.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.

jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.shell
Use shell to define the shell for a step. This keyword can reference several contexts. For more information, see "Contexts."

Supported platform	shell parameter	Description	Command run internally
Linux / macOS	unspecified	The default shell on non-Windows platforms. Note that this runs a different command to when bash is specified explicitly. If bash is not found in the path, this is treated as sh.	bash -e {0}
All	bash	The default shell on non-Windows platforms with a fallback to sh. When specifying a bash shell on Windows, the bash shell included with Git for Windows is used.	bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}
All	pwsh	The PowerShell Core. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name.	pwsh -command ". '{0}'"
All	python	Executes the python command.	python {0}
Linux / macOS	sh	The fallback behavior for non-Windows platforms if no shell is provided and bash is not found in the path.	sh -e {0}
Windows	cmd	GitHub appends the extension .cmd to your script name and substitutes for {0}.	%ComSpec% /D /E:ON /V:OFF /S /C "CALL "{0}"".
Windows	pwsh	This is the default shell used on Windows. The PowerShell Core. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name. If your self-hosted Windows runner does not have PowerShell Core installed, then PowerShell Desktop is used instead.	pwsh -command ". '{0}'".
Windows	powershell	The PowerShell Desktop. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name.	powershell -command ". '{0}'".
When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.			
jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.working-directory
Use working-directory to define the working directory for the shell for a step. This keyword can reference several contexts. For more information, see "Contexts."

Tip: Ensure the working-directory you assign exists on the runner before you run your shell in it.

When more than one default setting is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default setting. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting that has the same name defined in a workflow.
Example: Setting default run step options for a job
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash
        working-directory: ./scripts
jobs.<job_id>.steps
A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an action in your repository, a public repository, or an action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run actions, but all actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job.

GitHub only displays the first 1,000 checks, however, you can run an unlimited number of steps as long as you are within the workflow usage limits. For more information, see "Usage limits, billing, and administration" for GitHub-hosted runners and "About self-hosted runners" for self-hosted runner usage limits.

Example of jobs.<job_id>.steps
name: Greeting from Mona

on: push

jobs:
  my-job:
    name: My Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Print a greeting
        env:
          MY_VAR: Hi there! My name is
          FIRST_NAME: Mona
          MIDDLE_NAME: The
          LAST_NAME: Octocat
        run: |
          echo $MY_VAR $FIRST_NAME $MIDDLE_NAME $LAST_NAME.
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].id
A unique identifier for the step. You can use the id to reference the step in contexts. For more information, see "Contexts."

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].if
You can use the if conditional to prevent a step from running unless a condition is met. You can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional. For more information on which contexts are supported in this key, see "Contexts."

When you use expressions in an if conditional, you can, optionally, omit the ${{ }} expression syntax because GitHub Actions automatically evaluates the if conditional as an expression. However, this exception does not apply everywhere.

You must always use the ${{ }} expression syntax or escape with '', "", or () when the expression starts with !, since ! is reserved notation in YAML format. For example:

if: ${{ ! startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') }}
For more information, see "Expressions."

Example: Using contexts
This step only runs when the event type is a pull_request and the event action is unassigned.

steps:
  - name: My first step
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
    run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
Example: Using status check functions
The my backup step only runs when the previous step of a job fails. For more information, see "Expressions."

steps:
  - name: My first step
    uses: octo-org/action-name@main
  - name: My backup step
    if: ${{ failure() }}
    uses: actions/heroku@1.0.0
Example: Using secrets
Secrets cannot be directly referenced in if: conditionals. Instead, consider setting secrets as job-level environment variables, then referencing the environment variables to conditionally run steps in the job.

If a secret has not been set, the return value of an expression referencing the secret (such as ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }} in the example) will be an empty string.

name: Run a step if a secret has been set
on: push
jobs:
  my-jobname:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      super_secret: ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }}
    steps:
      - if: ${{ env.super_secret != '' }}
        run: echo 'This step will only run if the secret has a value set.'
      - if: ${{ env.super_secret == '' }}
        run: echo 'This step will only run if the secret does not have a value set.'
For more information, see "Contexts" and "Using secrets in GitHub Actions."

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].name
A name for your step to display on GitHub.

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].uses
Selects an action to run as part of a step in your job. An action is a reusable unit of code. You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a published Docker container image.

We strongly recommend that you include the version of the action you are using by specifying a Git ref, SHA, or Docker tag. If you don't specify a version, it could break your workflows or cause unexpected behavior when the action owner publishes an update.

Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.
If the action publishes major version tags, you should expect to receive critical fixes and security patches while still retaining compatibility. Note that this behavior is at the discretion of the action's author.
Using the default branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.
Some actions require inputs that you must set using the with keyword. Review the action's README file to determine the inputs required.

Actions are either JavaScript files or Docker containers. If the action you're using is a Docker container you must run the job in a Linux environment. For more details, see runs-on.

Example: Using versioned actions
steps:
  # Reference a specific commit
  - uses: actions/checkout@8f4b7f84864484a7bf31766abe9204da3cbe65b3
  # Reference the major version of a release
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  # Reference a specific version
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4.2.0
  # Reference a branch
  - uses: actions/checkout@main
Example: Using a public action
{owner}/{repo}@{ref}

You can specify a branch, ref, or SHA in a public GitHub repository.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        # Uses the default branch of a public repository
        uses: actions/heroku@main
      - name: My second step
        # Uses a specific version tag of a public repository
        uses: actions/aws@v2.0.1
Example: Using a public action in a subdirectory
{owner}/{repo}/{path}@{ref}

A subdirectory in a public GitHub repository at a specific branch, ref, or SHA.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: actions/aws/ec2@main
Example: Using an action in the same repository as the workflow
./path/to/dir

The path to the directory that contains the action in your workflow's repository. You must check out your repository before using the action.

Example repository file structure:

|-- hello-world (repository)
|   |__ .github
|       â””â”€â”€ workflows
|           â””â”€â”€ my-first-workflow.yml
|       â””â”€â”€ actions
|           |__ hello-world-action
|               â””â”€â”€ action.yml
The path is relative (./) to the default working directory (github.workspace, $GITHUB_WORKSPACE). If the action checks out the repository to a location different than the workflow, the relative path used for local actions must be updated.

Example workflow file:

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # This step checks out a copy of your repository.
      - name: My first step - check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # This step references the directory that contains the action.
      - name: Use local hello-world-action
        uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world-action
Example: Using a Docker Hub action
docker://{image}:{tag}

A Docker image published on Docker Hub.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: docker://alpine:3.8
Example: Using the GitHub Packages Container registry
docker://{host}/{image}:{tag}

A public Docker image in the GitHub Packages Container registry.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: docker://ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME
Example: Using a Docker public registry action
docker://{host}/{image}:{tag}

A Docker image in a public registry. This example uses the Google Container Registry at gcr.io.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: docker://gcr.io/cloud-builders/gradle
Example: Using an action inside a different private repository than the workflow
Your workflow must checkout the private repository and reference the action locally. Generate a personal access token and add the token as a secret. For more information, see "Managing your personal access tokens" and "Using secrets in GitHub Actions."

Replace PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in the example with the name of your secret.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: octocat/my-private-repo
          ref: v1.0
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          path: ./.github/actions/my-private-repo
      - name: Run my action
        uses: ./.github/actions/my-private-repo/my-action
Alternatively, use a GitHub App instead of a personal access token in order to ensure your workflow continues to run even if the personal access token owner leaves. For more information, see "Making authenticated API requests with a GitHub App in a GitHub Actions workflow."

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].run
Runs command-line programs that do not exceed 21,000 characters using the operating system's shell. If you do not provide a name, the step name will default to the text specified in the run command.

Commands run using non-login shells by default. You can choose a different shell and customize the shell used to run commands. For more information, see jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].shell.

Each run keyword represents a new process and shell in the runner environment. When you provide multi-line commands, each line runs in the same shell. For example:

A single-line command:

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install
A multi-line command:

- name: Clean install dependencies and build
  run: |
    npm ci
    npm run build
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].working-directory
Using the working-directory keyword, you can specify the working directory of where to run the command.

- name: Clean temp directory
  run: rm -rf *
  working-directory: ./temp
Alternatively, you can specify a default working directory for all run steps in a job, or for all run steps in the entire workflow. For more information, see "defaults.run.working-directory" and "jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.working-directory."

You can also use a run step to run a script. For more information, see "Essential features of GitHub Actions."

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].shell
You can override the default shell settings in the runner's operating system and the job's default using the shell keyword. You can use built-in shell keywords, or you can define a custom set of shell options. The shell command that is run internally executes a temporary file that contains the commands specified in the run keyword.

Supported platform	shell parameter	Description	Command run internally
Linux / macOS	unspecified	The default shell on non-Windows platforms. Note that this runs a different command to when bash is specified explicitly. If bash is not found in the path, this is treated as sh.	bash -e {0}
All	bash	The default shell on non-Windows platforms with a fallback to sh. When specifying a bash shell on Windows, the bash shell included with Git for Windows is used.	bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail {0}

Windows	pwsh	This is the default shell used on Windows. The PowerShell Core. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name. If your self-hosted Windows runner does not have PowerShell Core installed, then PowerShell Desktop is used instead.	pwsh -command ". '{0}'".
Windows	powershell	The PowerShell Desktop. GitHub appends the extension .ps1 to your script name.	powershell -command ". '{0}'".
Alternatively, you can specify a default shell for all run steps in a job, or for all run steps in the entire workflow. For more information, see "defaults.run.shell" and "jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run.shell."

Example: Running a command using Bash
steps:
  - name: Display the path
    shell: bash
    run: echo $PATH
Example: Running a command using Windows cmd
steps:
  - name: Display the path
    shell: cmd
    run: echo %PATH%
Example: Running a command using PowerShell Core
steps:
  - name: Display the path
    shell: pwsh
    run: echo ${env:PATH}
Example: Using PowerShell Desktop to run a command
steps:
  - name: Display the path
    shell: powershell
    run: echo ${env:PATH}
Example: Running an inline Python script
steps:
  - name: Display the path
    shell: python
    run: |
      import os
      print(os.environ['PATH'])
Custom shell
You can set the shell value to a template string using command [options] {0} [more_options]. GitHub interprets the first whitespace-delimited word of the string as the command, and inserts the file name for the temporary script at {0}.

For example:

steps:
  - name: Display the environment variables and their values
    shell: perl {0}
    run: |
      print %ENV
The command used, perl in this example, must be installed on the runner.

For information about the software included on GitHub-hosted runners, see "Using GitHub-hosted runners."

Exit codes and error action preference
For built-in shell keywords, we provide the following defaults that are executed by GitHub-hosted runners. You should use these guidelines when running shell scripts.

bash/sh:

By default, fail-fast behavior is enforced using set -e for both sh and bash. When shell: bash is specified, -o pipefail is also applied to enforce early exit from pipelines that generate a non-zero exit status.
You can take full control over shell parameters by providing a template string to the shell options. For example, bash {0}.
sh-like shells exit with the exit code of the last command executed in a script, which is also the default behavior for actions. The runner will report the status of the step as fail/succeed based on this exit code.
powershell/pwsh

Fail-fast behavior when possible. For pwsh and powershell built-in shell, we will prepend $ErrorActionPreference = 'stop' to script contents.
We append if ((Test-Path -LiteralPath variable:\LASTEXITCODE)) { exit $LASTEXITCODE } to powershell scripts so action statuses reflect the script's last exit code.
Users can always opt out by not using the built-in shell, and providing a custom shell option like: pwsh -File {0}, or powershell -Command "& '{0}'", depending on need.
cmd

There doesn't seem to be a way to fully opt into fail-fast behavior other than writing your script to check each error code and respond accordingly. Because we can't actually provide that behavior by default, you need to write this behavior into your script.
cmd.exe will exit with the error level of the last program it executed, and it will return the error code to the runner. This behavior is internally consistent with the previous sh and pwsh default behavior and is the cmd.exe default, so this behavior remains intact.
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with
A map of the input parameters defined by the action. Each input parameter is a key/value pair. Input parameters are set as environment variables. The variable is prefixed with INPUT_ and converted to upper case.

Input parameters defined for a Docker container must use args. For more information, see "jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with.args."

Example of jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with
Defines the three input parameters (first_name, middle_name, and last_name) defined by the hello_world action. These input variables will be accessible to the hello-world action as INPUT_FIRST_NAME, INPUT_MIDDLE_NAME, and INPUT_LAST_NAME environment variables.

jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: actions/hello_world@main
        with:
          first_name: Mona
          middle_name: The
          last_name: Octocat
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with.args
A string that defines the inputs for a Docker container. GitHub passes the args to the container's ENTRYPOINT when the container starts up. An array of strings is not supported by this parameter. A single argument that includes spaces should be surrounded by double quotes "".

Example of jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with.args
steps:
  - name: Explain why this job ran
    uses: octo-org/action-name@main
    with:
      entrypoint: /bin/echo
      args: The ${{ github.event_name }} event triggered this step.
The args are used in place of the CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you use CMD in your Dockerfile, use the guidelines ordered by preference:

Document required arguments in the action's README and omit them from the CMD instruction.
Use defaults that allow using the action without specifying any args.
If the action exposes a --help flag, or something similar, use that as the default to make your action self-documenting.
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with.entrypoint
Overrides the Docker ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile, or sets it if one wasn't already specified. Unlike the Docker ENTRYPOINT instruction which has a shell and exec form, entrypoint keyword accepts only a single string defining the executable to be run.

Example of jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].with.entrypoint
steps:
  - name: Run a custom command
    uses: octo-org/action-name@main
    with:
      entrypoint: /a/different/executable
The entrypoint keyword is meant to be used with Docker container actions, but you can also use it with JavaScript actions that don't define any inputs.

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env
Sets variables for steps to use in the runner environment. You can also set variables for the entire workflow or a job. For more information, see env and jobs.<job_id>.env.

When more than one environment variable is defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific variable. For example, an environment variable defined in a step will override job and workflow environment variables with the same name, while the step executes. An environment variable defined for a job will override a workflow variable with the same name, while the job executes.

Public actions may specify expected variables in the README file. If you are setting a secret or sensitive value, such as a password or token, you must set secrets using the secrets context. For more information, see "Contexts."

Example of jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env
steps:
  - name: My first action
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      FIRST_NAME: Mona
      LAST_NAME: Octocat
jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].continue-on-error
Prevents a job from failing when a step fails. Set to true to allow a job to pass when this step fails.

jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].timeout-minutes
The maximum number of minutes to run the step before killing the process.

jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes
The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360

If the timeout exceeds the job execution time limit for the runner, the job will be canceled when the execution time limit is met instead. For more information about job execution time limits, see "Usage limits, billing, and administration" for GitHub-hosted runners and "About self-hosted runners" for self-hosted runner usage limits.

Note: The GITHUB_TOKEN expires when a job finishes or after a maximum of 24 hours. For self-hosted runners, the token may be the limiting factor if the job timeout is greater than 24 hours. For more information on the GITHUB_TOKEN, see "Automatic token authentication."

jobs.<job_id>.strategy
Use jobs.<job_id>.strategy to use a matrix strategy for your jobs. A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code in multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems. For more information, see "Using a matrix for your jobs."

jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix
Use jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix to define a matrix of different job configurations. Within your matrix, define one or more variables followed by an array of values. For example, the following matrix has a variable called version with the value [10, 12, 14] and a variable called os with the value [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]:

jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
A job will run for each possible combination of the variables. In this example, the workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of the os and version variables.

By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability. The order of the variables in the matrix determines the order in which the jobs are created. The first variable you define will be the first job that is created in your workflow run. For example, the above matrix will create the jobs in the following order:

{version: 10, os: ubuntu-latest}
{version: 10, os: windows-latest}
{version: 12, os: ubuntu-latest}
{version: 12, os: windows-latest}
{version: 14, os: ubuntu-latest}
{version: 14, os: windows-latest}
A matrix will generate a maximum of 256 jobs per workflow run. This limit applies to both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners.

The variables that you define become properties in the matrix context, and you can reference the property in other areas of your workflow file. In this example, you can use matrix.version and matrix.os to access the current value of version and os that the job is using. For more information, see "Contexts."

Example: Using a single-dimension matrix
You can specify a single variable to create a single-dimension matrix.

For example, the following workflow defines the variable version with the values [10, 12, 14]. The workflow will run three jobs, one for each value in the variable. Each job will access the version value through the matrix.version context and pass the value as node-version to the actions/setup-node action.

jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [10, 12, 14]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
Example: Using a multi-dimension matrix
You can specify multiple variables to create a multi-dimensional matrix. A job will run for each possible combination of the variables.

For example, the following workflow specifies two variables:

Two operating systems specified in the os variable
Three Node.js versions specified in the version variable
The workflow will run six jobs, one for each combination of the os and version variables. Each job will set the runs-on value to the current os value and will pass the current version value to the actions/setup-node action.

jobs:
  example_matrix:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-22.04, ubuntu-20.04]
        version: [10, 12, 14]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.version }}
A variable configuration in a matrix can be an array of objects.

matrix:
  os:
    - ubuntu-latest
    - macos-latest
  node:
    - version: 14
    - version: 20
